## :interrobang: The Challenge

This is one of the challenges designed by Frontend Mentor in order to train and test my skills and knowledge using HTML and CSS. ðŸ”¥ðŸš€

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## :rocket: Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Gradient effects

### :gem: What I learned:

In this project I was able to learn how to work better with gradients using CSS, in addition to adding transition effects to them.
As a way of publishing this project, I also learned how to set up my own domain and use it on GitHub Pages.

- Create a branch with your functionality: `git checkout -b <your_feature_name>`;
